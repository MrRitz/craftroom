This site was created to showcase a login/sign up system.

Users can sign up and login info is saved on MySQL database.

During login the database is searched for correct credentials.
User passwords are encrypted in the database for added security.

Site also uses session to present a unique page to clients who are signed in.

After signed in it allows the client to upload images to the site owner for use in creating products.

It will push the image to a folder that the site owner has access to.
